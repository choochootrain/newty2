If you've got questions about what it's like to shift from being an entrepreneur to being a venture capitalist, both our interviewees can actually tell you. So how does this show work? You ask questions either in the comments or at askaVC(at)TechCrunch(dot)com and we'll put them forward to our VC guests.

So for our first taping, we have <a href="http://www.sparkcapital.com/team/nabeel-hyatt/">Nabeel Hyatt, who just joined Spark Capital in February after serving as a general manager at Zynga</a> (pictured at the right). He <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/zynga-buys-bostons-conduit-labs/">sold his company Conduit Labs to the social gaming giant</a> and that deal set the groundwork for Zynga's Boston studio. ]]></description>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got questions about what it&#8217;s like to shift from being an entrepreneur to being a venture capitalist, both our interviewees can actually tell you.</p>
<p>So how does this show work? You ask questions either in the comments or at askaVC(at)TechCrunch(dot)com and we&#8217;ll put them forward to our VC guests.</p>
<p>So for our first taping, we have <a href="http://www.sparkcapital.com/team/nabeel-hyatt/">Nabeel Hyatt, who just joined Spark Capital in February after serving as a general manager at Zynga</a> (pictured at the right). He <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/zynga-buys-bostons-conduit-labs/">sold his company Conduit Labs to the social gaming giant</a> and that deal set the groundwork for Zynga&#8217;s Boston studio.</p>
<p>Before that, he was a vice president of product at the MIT Media Lab spinoff Ambient Devices, which embedded information from the web into everyday objects like light bulbs, mirrors, refrigerators, and umbrellas to make the physical environment an interface to digital media.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got questions about what the &#8220;Zynga mafia&#8221; will end up being like, he&#8217;s probably the one to ask.</p>
<p>Then later this week <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/21/andreessen-horowitz-adds-new-venture-partner-to-go-after-enterprise-computing/">we have Peter Levine, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz</a>, who is extremely seasoned at company building (pictured at the top). Not only does he teach at Stanford&#8217;s Graduate School of Business and do mountain climbing, he has also served as CEO of XenSource, a provider of open source virtualization solutions that was acquired by Citrix Systems. He then became the senior vice president and general manager of Citrix&#8217;s data center and cloud division.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also actually a two-time venture capitalist. Before XenSource, he was a managing director at Mayfield. And then, before that, he was at Veritas Software where he started as an engineer when the company had just a few people. By the time he left 11 years later, the company was doing $1.5 billion in revenue, had nearly 6,000 people and he was one of three executive vice presidents, responsible for sales to hardware manufacturers, marketing, mergers and acquisitions and the Veritas venture fund. Like his firm&#8217;s other partners, he also writes regularly and has some good advice on <a href="http://peter.a16z.com/2012/05/01/what-now-board-meeting-or-bullsht/">how to run board meetings</a> and evaluate sales deals here.</p>
<p>Levine has recently gotten the firm into deals like Actifio, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/05/virtualization-data-management-startup-raises-33-5m-from-andreessen-horowitz-others/">the virtualization data management software maker that raised $33.5 million</a> in December. So if you have questions about Andreessen&#8217;s enterprise strategy or the firm&#8217;s unique approach, he&#8217;s the one to ask.</p>

<p>The latest Instagram/Facebook detail the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattering_classes">chattering classes</a> are seizing on? Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s position in the deal. Basically, Andreessen Horowitz <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/05/burbn-funding/">pitched seed funding</a> into Instagram in its earliest days but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/andreessen-horowitz-isnt-hedging-its-bets-with-picplz-and-instagram-it-has-picked-picplz/">ultimately opted to place</a> more of its money and support behind <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/picplz">PicPlz</a>, a competing mobile photo sharing app. Today the <em>New York Times</em> published <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/how-andreessen-horowitz-fumbled-an-instagram-investment/">an article</a> about the situation &#8212; the not-so-delicately titled &#8220;How Andreessen Horowitz Bunted on an Instagram Investment&#8221; &#8212; that tells the story in all its <em>schadenfreude</em>-inducing glory.</p>
<p>Well at least one person has had enough of the snark: PicPlz co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dalton-caldwell">Dalton Caldwell</a>. In a comment today on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3869449">the Hacker News thread</a> about the aforementioned <em>New York Times</em> piece, he defended PicPlz (which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/08/picplz-pivotplz/">eventually pivoted into being a part of </a> into <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixed-media-labs">Mixed Media Labs</a>, a broader smartphone app development company that has since spawned <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/app-net">mobile platform App.net</a>) and encouraged other entrepreneurs to ignore the score-keeping perpetuated by the media and tech industry gossip.</p>
<p>His whole comment is kind of awesome, so we&#8217;re reposting it in its entirety here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anyone reading this article needs to remember to never be afraid of putting yourself out there because you are afraid of failure.</p>
<p>I saw the market first, I created picplz, and I went for it. I was a huge believe in the mobile photo sharing opportunity, and I went for it with all of my heart. Clearly, picplz didn&#8217;t win, but I have ZERO shame or regret for doing my best.</p>
<p>When I read articles like these, which are about myself, my company and people that I know well, I can&#8217;t help but feel vitriol aimed at me for DARING to create, launch and raise funding for picplz. I am not clear on what exactly people want, an apology for trying?</p>
<p>The fact is, I saw the writing on the wall that we wouldn&#8217;t win early and pivoted out of photo sharing which I had ~90% of my series A cash still in the bank. It certainly seems like that was the right move, but all of this press makes it look like pivoting was the wrong call(?) The press I read is written in such a way that it assumed that the A16Z investment is dead and my entire company should just be written off to zero today. That is bullshit. If I started to take press like this too seriously I might as well just dissolve my company and stop coming into work.</p>
<p>I say this to the hn comminity: never be afraid of failure. No one knows what will happen. All of this arm-chair quarterbacking is a waste of time. Stop reading this kind of crap and instead put your energy into doing your best work. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose, but if you give yourself the opportunity to win enough times, you WILL be successful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Marc Andreessen also weighed in on the thread, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to add that all of us at AH are very proud of Dalton and his team, and we are highly excited about the new plan (including all the parts that aren&#8217;t public yet  .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In all it serves as an important reminder that for all the fun that we have buzzing about the tech industry on blogs and Twitter, the people who are hard at work building things are the real reason we&#8217;re all here in the space at all. It&#8217;s always going to be easier to pick things apart than to put them together &#8212; but in the end, those who stay focused on being productive and positive usually wind up better off than the others, in one way or another.</p>

<p>The move follows the bigger trend of startup execs/founders getting snapped up by the VC firms, to help them get a bit smarter in how they work with their portfolio companies. Just yesterday, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/02/first-round-capital-brings-on-scribds-jack-leidlein-as-head-of-talent/">First Round Capital</a> hired Scribd&#8217;s Jack Leidlein as head of talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that eventually leads me back to doing what I’ve done for the past three and a half years — namely, building cool things with awesome people with unexpected results,&#8221; Sciarra wrote in a <a href="http://blog.pinterest.com/post/20380014788/from-pinterest-co-founder-paul-sciarra">blog post</a> on the Pinterest site.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz is one of Pinterest&#8217;s investors, along with Bessemer Venture Partners, Ron Conway and several others. Together they have put <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pinterest">$35.7 million</a> into Pinterest, considered one of the fastest-growing social networking sites ever, with comScore reporting in January 2012 that it had 11.7 million uniques.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz is one of the leaders among VCs building out the services that they offer to young companies beyond funding. The EIC role will see Sciarra potentially help Andreessen evaluate future investments, offer advice and assistance to its portfolio companies and perhaps even aid Andreessen Horowitz to be more disruptive in its own ventures.</p>
<p>Pinterest, with its pinning of images on Pinboards, has shifted a lot of people&#8217;s thinking about how to represent information in a more visual way. It will be interesting to see how and if that follows through here, or whether the ideas Sciarra spins out will be in entirely different areas. Before Cold Brew Labs really got into its groove with Pinterest, there were probably a lot of other concepts floating around. Will we see some of them surfacing here?</p>
<p>One other question to ponder: With big changes afoot for both Silvermann and Sciarra, the remaining co-founder, Evan Sharp, is noted to be currently focused on product. What&#8217;s next for him?</p>

To stay competitive and top-of-mind, VC’s are no longer loaning their advice and their capital, but actual “core” services that portfolio companies need. This shift isn’t necessarily new. For example, top VC firms like Kleiner Perkins and Greylock play a hands-on role in helping recruit talent. Recently, we’ve seen firms roll up their sleeves for another core competency: public relations.

More often, I'll be pitched on a story on a startup by the in-house PR rep for an investment firm that has invested in the said startup. Traditionally, either the startup or an outside PR agency tends to do the outreach when it comes to launches, trend pieces, financings or other news items. And the rise in pitches from the VC firms themselves (as opposed to the startups) got me thinking about the evolution of the role of the VC, specifically in the context of PR. But in the past year or so, we've seen a rise in the addition of top PR and communications talent to these firms, specifically to help work with portfolio companies on PR strategy.

To stay competitive and top-of-mind, VC’s are no longer loaning their advice and their capital, but actual “core” services that portfolio companies need. This shift isn’t necessarily new. For example, top VC firms like Kleiner Perkins and Greylock play a hands-on role in helping recruit talent. Recently, we’ve seen firms roll up their sleeves for another core competency: public relations.</p>
<p>More often, I&#8217;ll be pitched on a story on a startup by the in-house PR rep for an investment firm that has invested in the said startup. Traditionally, either the startup or an outside PR agency tends to do the outreach when it comes to launches, trend pieces, financings or other news items. And the rise in pitches from the VC firms themselves (as opposed to the startups) got me thinking about the evolution of the role of the VC, specifically in the context of PR. But in the past year or so, we&#8217;ve seen a rise in the addition of top PR and communications talent to these firms, specifically to help work with portfolio companies on PR strategy.</p>
<p>One of the first major hires in the industry <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">was the addition of PR honcho Margit Wennmachers</a>, co-founder of one of the largest technology and media PR firms OutCast Communications, to Andreessen Horowitz as a partner. At the time, Marc Andreessen told AllThingsD&#8217;s Kara Swisher that Wennmachers&#8217; brand building and PR experience would be a valuable asset to the firm and its portfolio. Mind you, Andreessen Horowitz wisely realized only a year after launching the firm that building a VC powerhouse would be more than just writing checks, but also a consultancy of sorts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.googleventures.com/team/david-krane">David Krane</a>, Google&#8217;s former Director of Global Communications and Public Affairs, and one the company&#8217;s first PR reps back when it was just a startup, wears two hats at Google Ventures, where he is now a partner. He invests in startups but also helps Google Ventures portfolio companies with PR strategy as well.</p>
<p>in April 2010, Sand Hill VC Kleiner Perkins <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110415/like-andreessen-horowitz-kleiner-hires-marketing-partner-for-silicon-valley-vc-firm/"> nabbed</a> former head of communications for Hulu (and previous PR/marketing employee at Amazon and Microsoft) Christina Lee to head marketing and PR for the firm. Last fall, PR guru Kiersten Hollars (formerly of Outcast, Yahoo, Digg, and AOL) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/kiersten-hollars-moves-from-aol-comm-vp-to-andreessen-partner/">joined Wennmachers&#8217; team at Andreessen Horowitz</a>, focusing on scaling the marketing and PR efforts for the then 80 companies in the firm&#8217;s portfolio. And most recently we saw Google senior manager in PR <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111229/sequoia-grabs-googler-to-head-new-comms-role-to-help-entrepreneurs/">Andrew Kovacs jump to Sequoia</a> to help the firm&#8217;s marketing partner, Mark Dempster with PR and communications duties for the firm’s companies in the U.S. and Israel.</p>
<p>Clearly some of the brightest and most well-regarded talent in the technology PR industry are no longer just at agencies or in-house. As Emily Mendell, VP of communications for the National Venture Capital Association, tells me, the VC market is extremely competitive for deal flow. &#8220;There are a lot of firms chasing for deals in the hottest, early stage startups, and PR representation and communications strategy is just another service these firms can offer while at the negotiating table,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>And technology PR is not an easy task—to do the job well, it requires a technical understanding of the product and the ability to digest and relay this information in a communicable way. Startups realize that having this on-hand at their investment firm is an asset to them, Mendell explains.</p>
<p>And many of the pr execs mentioned above are solely focused on helping portfolio companies as opposed to doing in-house communications for the firms themselves. Lee tells me that part of the trend of more VC firms bringing on PR talent is a reflection of how the role of communications is changing in the tech industry in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now smart entrepreneurs understand the value in being transparent with consumers, and the role of communications has risen to a strategic level,&#8221; she says. &#8220;PR is expected to play a big part in building brands and more and more startups are thinking about PR and branding at an earlier stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kleiner, specifically, is taking a holistic approach to company building, and part of this is providing communications and PR help to startups and companies, she explains.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a range of different ways which VC PR reps can help entrepreneurs and companies from simple tasks such as introductions to technology journalists to actually spearheading PR efforts for a product launch, to coaching companies on branding and messaging strategy to drafting press releases.</p>
<p>Another industry source tells me that while some firms are bringing on PR talent for the use of portfolio companies, others are trying to use PR to boost their own images, and promote their VCs to the press.</p>
<p>One factor that I believe is pushing the trend of building reps and even mini-agencies in-house is the rise in seed stage investing by these VC firms and the competitive market at this level. There are no shortage of VCs and angels that are willing to write checks at the seed level nowadays. Many firms can&#8217;t just get deal flow based on reputation alone. But the VC firms ability to be a &#8216;full-service&#8217; agency can be a factor entrepreneurs consider when sitting down at the table. This is especially important for early-stage companies, who may not have the kind of money to hire a top-tier PR firm to handle PR, says one industry insider.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, part of this full-service package also includes recruiting, which is a trend that has been happening for some time now. Kleiner Perkins partner <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/partner/juliet-de-baubigny">Juliet de Baubigny</a> has been helping portfolio companies with human capital and recruiting for the past ten years. Greylock <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/17/greylock-looks-to-help-portfolio-companies-recruit-talent-with-new-hires/">recently created a dedicated talent team</a> to help its portfolio companies recruit effectively. Firms like Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia are also <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/07/14/venture-firms-battle-to-woo-top-tech-talent/">aggressively working</a> to help startups network and recruit talent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this &#8216;full service&#8217; model has been offered by incubators like Y Combinator, TechStars and 500 Startups though both in-house talent as well as through mentorship. While it&#8217;s a stretch to call the VC firms mentioned above incubators, it&#8217;s certainly interesting to see the overall functionality of these large firms evolve with the current state of investing.</p>
<p>As firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and others create these full-service VC funds that not only dole out cash but come with in-house PR agencies, marketing resource and talent recruiter, there&#8217;s no doubt that this trend will filter down to smaller firms and funds.</p>

Today, partner Ben Horowitz <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/01/31/why-has-andreessen-horowitz-raised-2-7b-in-3-years/">has confirmed</a> that the fund has closed, bringing Andreessen Horowitz's total funding under management to $2.7 billion.

The firm says that the $1.5 billion was raised for its Fund III. “a16z’s Fund III is all about extending our capabilities to more disruptors and pioneers,” said Horowitz in a release. “We’re remaking the modern venture capital firm, and entrepreneurs are responding to our unique approach.”

Today, partner Ben Horowitz <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/01/31/why-has-andreessen-horowitz-raised-2-7b-in-3-years/">has confirmed</a> that the fund has closed, bringing Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s total funding under management to $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>The firm says that the $1.5 billion was raised for its Fund III. “a16z’s Fund III is all about extending our capabilities to more disruptors and pioneers,” said Horowitz in a release. “We’re remaking the modern venture capital firm, and entrepreneurs are responding to our unique approach.”</p>
<p>One of the differentiators Horowitz and Andreessen made with their fund is that the firm&#8217;s network be made available firm wide, Horowitz explains in his blog post. This has helped create a vast network for portfolio companies, he says.</p>
<p>Horowitz reveals that in 2011, the firm hosted over 600 portfolio presentations to corporate customers and partners at their office in Menlo Park. These presentations resulted in more than 3,000 introductions between portfolio companies and prospective Fortune 500/Global 2000 senior executives.</p>
<p>The firm has relationships with over 4,000 engineers, designers and product managers, has made more than 1,300 introductions to portfolio companies, resulting in 130 hires within the portfolio. And Andreessen Horowitz has added over 550 executives to its network in 2011 and made more than 300 executive introductions to portfolio companies.</p>
<p>“Software is the catalyst that will remake entire industries during the next decade. We are single-mindedly focused on partnering with the best innovators pursuing the biggest markets,” co-founder Marc Andreessen explained in the release announcing the new fund. This is the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/06/andreessen-horowitz-announces-yet-another-growth-fund-of-200m/">third fund</a> for the firm.</p>
<p>In October, Michael Arrington <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2011/10/26/andreessen-horowitz-raising-huge-new-900-million-fund-iii/">reported</a> that AH was raising a $900 million new fund, and AllThingsD <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111209/if-drafted-andreessen-horowitz-will-not-run-yahoo-but-well-buy-it-cheap/">revealed</a> in December 2011 that the firm was raising as much as $1.5 billion for the fund. As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/andreessen-horowitz-raising-900-million-third-fund-triple-the-size-of-its-first/">stated in a filing</a> from last year, the new $1.5 billion fund will provide Andreessen Horowitz with the flexibility to invest anything “from $10,000 to $100 million” in fledgling startups and growth companies. Founded in 2009, the firm currently has six general partners including Jeff Jordan, Peter Levine, John O’Farrell, Scott Weiss, plus Horowitz and Marc Andreessen.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s investments include Zynga, Foursquare, Airbnb, Kno, Groupon, Airtime, Box.net, Pinterest, Asana, Lytro, BOKU, and Jawbone.</p>

<p>Ok then. Here&#8217;s a recent video interview of Papaioannou talking about trends in big data:</p>

<p>Founded in 2010, the startup has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/actifio/">secured</a> a total of $57.5 million in venture capital funding to date.</p>
<p>Actifio bills itself as a &#8216;Protection and Availability Storage&#8217; platform company, offering data management solutions to small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and managed service and cloud service providers. </p>
<p>This is what the formal pitch sounds like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actifio’s mission is to virtualize management of data and consumerize the operations to enable transformation of the data center into an SLA-driven services organization. </p>
<p>Beginning with addressing IT’s most frustrating challenges (backup, disaster recovery and business continuity), the Actifio PAS platform is expanding to address test and development, analytics, compliance, e-discovery and other business-critical requirements, creating a new category of storage that efficiently virtualizes and manages copies of production data.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Levine, a veteran enterprise IT exec (Veritas, XenSource, Citrix) and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has joined Actifio’s board.</p>
<p>Actifio is led by CEO Ash Ashutosh (formerly VP &amp; chief technologist of HP’s StorageWorks division), president Jim Sullivan (previously VP, Worldwide Sales at IBM System Storage) and David Chang (formerly founder and VP of Product Management at AppIQ &#8211; acquired by HP).</p>

<p>Andreessen Horowitz has been very busy for such a young firm, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine that they <em>didn&#8217;t</em> see a heck of lot of deal-flow from day one, considering the networks and clout of its founding partners (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-horowitz">Ben Horowitz</a>).</p>
<p>AH has investments in companies like Zynga, Foursquare, Airbnb, Kno, Groupon, Airtime, Box.net, Pinterest, Asana, Lytro, BOKU, Jawbone and many more (you can see a list of portfolio companies <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">on CrunchBase</a>). They also did ok with the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/ebay-skype-sale/">sale of Skype</a>, one of their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/31/skype-sale-to-investor-group-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-confirmed/">first investments</a>.</p>
<p>The firm has roughly $1.25 billion under management today, so the new fund (especially if they raise an additional round for follow-up investments just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/06/andreessen-horowitz-announces-yet-another-growth-fund-of-200m/">like they did</a> with their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/andreessen-horowitz-650m-fund/">second fund</a>) will just about double that amount.</p>
<p>Arrington, who says his source has seen the documents, reports that the new fund will provide Andreessen Horowitz with the flexibility to invest anything &#8220;from $10,000 to $100 million&#8221; in fledgling startups and growth companies.</p>
<p>The firm now has five general partners (aside from Horowitz and Andreessen, there&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/20/andreessen-horowitz-celebrates-first-year-with-new-general-partner-john-ofarrell/">John O&#8217;Farrell</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-jordan-4">Jeff Jordan</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/21/andreessen-horowitz-adds-new-venture-partner-to-go-after-enterprise-computing/">Scott Weiss</a>). Andreessen Horowitz also recently announced that it has brought on former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers as a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/larry-summers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-special-advisor/">special advisor</a>.</p>
<p>In related news, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/khosla-ventures">Khosla Ventures</a> just raised a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/khosla-ventures-1-billion-fund/">$1 billion fund</a>. A cash crunch? Where?</p>

Horowitz spoke to his history with his founding partner as well as what the two tech veterans look for in the companies they invest in and mentor.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at the end of the talk, Heilemann played a word association game with Horowitz, asking him what he thought about Facebook (among other big tech companies). Horowitz said frankly that he thought the social networking giant is the best run company in Silicon Valley &#8212; and the tech industry.</p>
<p>When asked whether that was a product of CEO Mark Zuckerberg or the people around him, Horowitz said, of course, that he thought it was a product of both. &#8220;I pay a lot of attention young CEOs, and I think Mark is one of the best young CEOs in the business&#8221;. The reason for this? Zuckerberg is incredibly thoughtful about product strategy, Horowitz said. </p>
<p>He cited the example of how, when new hires arrive at Facebook, they are often forced to take lower titles than what they&#8217;re used to. Zuckerberg established this precedent because he wants people coming to Facebook not to be focused on their title, but instead on what kind of awesome products they&#8217;re going to build. He wants to make sure they&#8217;re at Facebook for the right reasons &#8212; not because the&#8217;ve seen The Social Network, for example.</p>
<p>Zuck is extremely focused on the little things, Horowitz said, which is what will make him successful in the long run. And it&#8217;s this attention to detail, and staying focused on the long-term roadmap that has pushed the young CEO and the people installed around him, that has pushed them to have the same onboarding process for people at all levels of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not interested in building products, you&#8217;re not going to play at Facebook&#8221;, the investor said.</p>
<p>Horowitz&#8217;s words are slightly surprising in light of the heat that the young CEO has taken over the years for being an uncomfortable presence on stage, lacking in charisma, among other things. While Andreessen Horowitz hasn&#8217;t invested officially in Facebook, Marc Andreessen does sit on the board of directors. And since Horowitz admitted that he and Andreessen are &#8220;best friends&#8221; and like an &#8220;old married couple&#8221;, obviously the young company is something both investors are well familiar with.</p>
<p>Horowitz also shared his thoughts on some other technology industry notables like Groupon and Zynga. He called Groupon &#8220;the fastest growing company in the world&#8221;, said that Twitter is &#8220;changing the world&#8221;, and was unable to say much more about Zynga (with its IPO looming) other than &#8220;I love it&#8221;. In relation to Steve Jobs, the investor said &#8220;it&#8217;s just so spectacular what he did in the world and with his life. I like how many people he proved wrong over and over again&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Marker was the first to report the news (in <a href="http://www.themarker.com/news/1.670254">Hebrew</a>, Google Translate <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=iw&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themarker.com%2Fnews%2F1.670254">version</a>).  I&#8217;ve confirmed the investment with Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>There is a bit of an HP connection here.  Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz also sold their company, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/opsware">Opsware</a>, to HP in 2007 for $1.6 billion.  Andreessen currently sits on the <a href="http://h30261.www3.hp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71087&amp;p=irol-govboard">board</a> of HP.  They are certainly aware of Mercury&#8217;s contribution to HP&#8217;s business, but also have an appreciation for enterprise startups given their Opsware experience.</p>

It hasn&#8217;t even been four months since the consumer electronics company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/16/jawbone-raises-49-million-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-dominate-your-mobile-accessory-world/">closed</a> its $49 million in funding from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a> and already it&#8217;s making funding news again.</p>
<p>Jawbone has raised another round of growth funding, this time it&#8217;s $70 million from a group of unnamed investors advised by JP Morgan Asset Management. This brings the total raised so far to $170 million.</p>
<p>Is there RedBull in the water over at Jawbone? The company seemed to motor along for years with its $50 million in capital, making sci-fi-looking mobile headsets. Suddenly CEO Hosain Rahman has thrown the company into hyper-drive.</p>
<p>In addition to raising nearly $120 million in capital in a matter of months, the company is doing business in 28 countries, and has moved into new types of mobile accessories with the Jambox Smart Speaker. And we hear the company will announce a new major product category tomorrow.</p>
<p>Two things explain the surge of activity, according to Rahman. One is that it just took time for Jawbone to build out its global supply chain and get to scale. There&#8217;s a reason VCs don&#8217;t back a lot of consumer electronics companies. Even with the advantages of globalization, it&#8217;s not easy. But now that it&#8217;s in place, Jawbone can more quickly expand out to other products.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another big reason for the sudden need-for-speed: Jawbone&#8217;s long-term vision&#8211; that phones would be the center of our worlds with lines hopelessly blurred between consumer and professional devices&#8211;suddenly went from futuristic idea to current reality thanks to the iPhone, Android and the surge of investment around those platforms. &#8220;The world came to us faster than we could have expected,&#8221; Rahman says. &#8220;The surprise isn&#8217;t that it happened; it&#8217;s how quickly it happened. As recently as 2007 Blackberry was an $80 billion company. It&#8217;s amazing how fast the rise and fall of companies in this space has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile as the big giants slug it out, Jawbone is one of the only pre-IPO consumer electronics companies building innovative hardware, software and UI design for the broader smart phone market.</p>
<p>So, not only has the world come to Jawbone faster than it could have expected&#8211; investors like JP Morgan have looking for a way to invest in this trend beyond just buying shares of Apple. &#8220;We just said yes,&#8221; Rahman says.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/larry-summers.jpeg" rel="lightbox[319295]"></a><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a> is announcing today that economist, former US Treasury Secretary and former President of Harvard Larry Summers is joining the firm as a special advisor.</p>
<p>Beyond his well known academic and political credentials, Marc Andreessen was quick to point out that Summers has nerd cred too: He was admitted at MIT at the age of 16 to study physics.</p>
<p>Summers will be part time, acting in an advisory role exclusive to the firm. Specifically, he&#8217;ll be helping startups think through economic and pricing models as they strive to disrupt large industries, not only in the United States but in the turbulent and ever-changing global economy.</p>
<p>Although Andreessen Horowitz is one of the only big name Silicon Valley firms not investing in emerging markets directly, all of its companies are seeking to tap into them and many like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/16/jawbone-raises-49-million-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-dominate-your-mobile-accessory-world/">Jawbone</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/shoedazzle">ShoeDazzle</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/21/lytro-launches-to-transform-photography-with-50m-in-venture-funds-tctv/">Lytro</a> are made possible by the flattened, global economy.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the role comes from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/hal-varian">Hal Varian</a>, a top economist who played a pivotal role in helping Google rethink the ad market, laying the foundation for several of the key algorithms that went into the paid search model, Andreessen says.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the conduit for Summers and Andreessen&#8217;s relationship was Facebook COO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sheryl-sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, an early protege of Summers at Harvard who also worked with him at the World Bank and the Treasury. Andreessen is on Facebook&#8217;s board, and several months ago Sandberg insisted the two meet. As a side note, Sandberg is only the second person I&#8217;ve ever heard Andreessen describe as &#8220;a human router&#8221;&#8211; the first being, <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/04/07/ron-conway-explained/">you guessed it</a>, Ron Conway.</p>
<p>The big question is whether this is just one of those glitzy big name announcements venture firms like to make that we never hear about again&#8211; ala <a href="http://www.elevation.com/EP_IT.asp?id=112">Bono</a>, <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/team/index.php?Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>, and <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/team/index.php?Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a> &#8211; or whether Larry Summers will actually make a meaningful impact on Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s portfolio companies. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what has gone well or not at other firms, but I know what we&#8217;re going to do and several of our entrepreneurs have already starting meeting with him,&#8221; Andreessen says.</p>
<p>According to Summers, the firm isn&#8217;t being shy with requests. &#8220;I go to bed most nights with emails from Marc and wake up most mornings with more emails from Marc,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be solving the problems in their routing systems, but I&#8217;ll be a sounding board giving my insights on the global economy and the feasibility and attractiveness of different pricing schemes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course I couldn&#8217;t let a world-famous economist entering the Silicon Valley investing fray off the phone without answering another question: Are we in a tech bubble? He noted that economists never give yes or no answers, and added that given the breadth of the Web, the scale of the market, and the revenues associated with the ruling tech startups rendered any comparisons to the late 1990s &#8220;too facile.&#8221; But as a good economist, he hedged all that saying one always had to be wary when euphoria is building. I asked if this was a period of euphoria now and he demurred, saying he was sticking to the intentionally vague answer above. In other words, I got a solid &#8220;not now but maybe later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Mr. Summers has clearer answers for Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s portfolio. If <a href="http://www.moviequotesandmore.com/social-network-quotes-2.html">his depiction</a> in The Social Network was remotely accurate (a big if considering the film in question) he&#8217;ll win points among many entrepreneurs. He was the voice of reason advising the Winklevoss twins to &#8220;come up with a new project&#8221; and telling them their whining wasn&#8217;t &#8220;worthy of Harvard.&#8221; Amen to that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/screen-shot-2011-06-24-at-2-11-42-pm.png?w=0&amp;h=0&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen shot 2011-06-24 at 2.11.42 PM" title="Screen shot 2011-06-24 at 2.11.42 PM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/foursquare_logo.png" rel="lightbox[317636]"></a>Foursquare has just closed one of the most secretive rounds of venture capital TechCrunch has seen.</p>
<p>The company is raising $50 million, and all of it will go towards building out the company, no secondary sales here. The valuation had been rumored to be as high as $1 billion, but our sources say it settled out at $550 million pre-money, $600 million post.</p>
<p>Part of that is because the round was mostly done by insiders. Leading it was <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, still the only major Valley firm invested in the company. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-horowitz">Ben Horowitz</a> did the deal and is remaining a board observer only. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/o-reilly-alphatech-ventures">OATV</a> also reupped in this round and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/spark-capital">Spark Capital</a> came in as a new investor, but not the lead. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bijan-sabet">Bijan Sabet</a> is joining as a board observer as well. The money will be used to build out the merchant platform, the San Francisco office and fuel international expansion, said founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dennis-crowley">Dennis Crowley</a> in an interview.</p>
<p>Foursquare&#8217;s ten million users are impressive for a mobile app, but small compared to numbers other major social networks. Its revenues are scant. Some firms said they shied away from the deal, because they felt monetization was only more unclear now. With the local space on fire, Foursquare&#8217;s target advertisers are already beset with sales people from Yelp, Living Social, Groupon, Google and others calling on them. There&#8217;s going to be a level of retailer fatigue, and business-wise Foursquare is late to the party.</p>
<p>Crowley emphasized that Foursquare has a very different value proposition from competitors and is focused on not only rewarding loyal patrons but tracking how their referrals snake through the social graph offering different kinds of rewards to new customers, repeat customers, referred customers and of course the mayors in a way that only Foursquare can. The company is still working on the merchant platform and will get aggressive on selling through direct sales and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/amex-foursquare-revenue-free-zone/">partnerships</a> once they feel it&#8217;s perfect, Crowley said. &#8220;We know what it&#8217;s going to be, we just haven&#8217;t flipped the switch on it yet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A $600 million valuation is a big but not unreasonable step-up from Foursquare&#8217;s last round which was priced at $120 million. That&#8217;s still rich, but that&#8217;s the market. Plus, from the venture firm&#8217;s perspective, a heady valuation only matters so much. Only slightly more than $20 million has been invested so far in the company, and any investor will have a liquidation preference, meaning they get paid first in the event of an acquisition. So a $50 million deal at any price wouldn&#8217;t <em>lose</em> money unless Foursquare winds up being worth less than $70 million.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about this round was how deadly quiet Foursquare was able to keep the news. A few of the big Valley firms like Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark weren&#8217;t in the bidding for competitive reasons and very few others were invited to take a look at it. Few of Foursquare&#8217;s angel investors were even briefed about it. &#8220;Loose Tweets sink companies,&#8221; Crowley said. &#8220;The series B played out very publicly and it was hard for the company, so we came up with a better process this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have heard the company might be working on an additional round to cash out some early investors, to be closed at a later date. Crowley didn&#8217;t have a comment on that, other than to emphasize all of this round is going towards building the company and the door is open to future secondary deals if it&#8217;s the right thing for investors and the company.</p>

This is also the company for anyone who thinks Silicon Valley has fallen into a rut of innovation-less posing. And it&#8217;s the company for anyone who complains that the Valley is more about media and marketing than brass-knuckles, hardcore technology. This is the company that jaded, cranky, rap-lyric quoting investor Ben Horowitz says, &#8220;blew my brains to bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, Lytro is developing a new type of camera that dramatically changes photography for the first time since the 1800s. Rather than just capturing one plane of light, it captures the entire light field around a picture, all in one shot taken on a single device. A light field includes every beam of light in every direction at every point in time. Experimentation in this field started in the mid-1990s at Stanford with 100 cameras in one room. Lytro&#8217;s innovation is making it small enough to fit in your pocket. Really.</p>
<p>As a result you can refocus photos after the fact, wiggle around the orientation, and even show the photos in 3D. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jasonkincaid/statuses/888167165">Get excited, Jason Kincaid</a>, because it&#8217;s not too far away from those 3D moving photographs in the Harry Potter movies. The company has raised $50 million so far from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/new-enterprise-associates">NEA</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/k9-ventures">K9 Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock">Greylock Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out in this photo below by Richard Koci Hernandez. Click around to see Elvis come into focus in the foreground:</p>
<iframe width="620" height="500" src="http://www.lytro.com/pictures/lyt-37/embed?bgColor=0xffffff" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Here&#8217;s some of what Horowitz wrote <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2011/06/21/lytro-and-the-magic-camera/">on his blog</a> about the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People often refer to taking a picture as capturing the moment, but conventional photography does not really capture the moment. It captures one angle, one set of light, and one focus of the moment. If you are a professional photographer, you might capture the best parts of the moment. If you are someone like me, you most certainly will not. With Ren’s light field camera, you actually capture the moment or at least all of the light that visually represents the moment.</p>
<p>Once you have captured the moment, you can go back at any time and get the picture that you want.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can take the picture you wish you would have taken after the fact. If you are used to the old paradigm, it’s like travelling backwards through time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there are big risks with any business this jaw-droppingly innovative. Will they be able to get the price point low enough that people will buy the camera? Right now, the closest Ng will commit on price is somewhere between north of $1 and less than $10,000. That&#8217;s a pretty broad ballpark. We won&#8217;t be able to see the devices until the also vague &#8220;sometime this year.&#8221; An equally important question is whether the user experience be as simple as the company claims.</p>
<p>We invited the CEO and founder Ren Ng into the TechCrunchTV studio to answer some of these questions, give us a demo and tell us more about this undeniably cool company. Video below.</p>

The round is being lead by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, and includes participation from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digital-sky-technologies">DST</a>, say our sources.

That's a big increase from the company's last funding round of <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/airbnb-2">$7.2 million</a>, which included Sequoia Capital, Greylock, SV Angel, Ashton Kutcher and Youniversity Ventures (Kutcher <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/30/disrupt-backstage-ashton-kutcher-airbnb/">broke the news</a> that he's an investor in AirBnB at TechCrunch Disrupt last week). The company, which launched via Y Combinator, has raised just $7.8 million to date.

No surprise, it was a hotly contested deal. The service has exploded, growing more than <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/06/airbnb-2010/">800%</a> last year and booking 1.6 million night stays in other people's homes to date.

On any given night in New York there are more people staying in homes via Airbnb than there are rooms in the biggest hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Airbnb has become the sleeper hit of the startup world. It&#8217;s one of those companies plenty of well-heeled investors passed on in the early days, because they thought no one would want to open his or her home to strangers. Out of twenty angels he pitched in 2008, founder Brian Chesky said half didn&#8217;t return his emails and most of the others told him it was an awful idea. Even Paul Graham hated it, but he liked Chesky and backed him hoping he&#8217;d change the company. TechCrunch&#8217;s own hotel expert Paul Carr was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/25/fawlty-logic/">cynic</a> too.</p>
<p>Now, the fear of missing another Airbnb is palpable in the Valley, and one of the reasons GetAround became the darling, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/25/and-the-winner-of-techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-is-getaround/">audience choice and winner</a> of our Disrupt conference this week.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, I sat down with Airbnb founder Brian Chesky to talk about this reversal in fortune and how the business is going, although at the time we hadn&#8217;t heard the details of the deal he was busy negotiating. Check it out below.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[</a>I guess $1 billion under management just wasn't enough. Andreessen Horowitz has just announced a new growth fund of $200 million. The fund with co-invest alongside the firm's most recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/andreessen-horowitz-650m-fund/">$650 million fund</a>, providing more capital for the kinds of late stage deals that have been raging in the Valley of late. (Check out our three part series on the trend <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/is-late-stage-the-new-early/">here</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/29/benchmark-capitals-stand-we-will-never-do-a-seed-or-late-stage-fund/">here</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/03/how-we-all-missed-web-2-0s-netscape-moment/">here</a>.)

That "co-invest" part is makes this announcement very different from other firms' late stage funds, says general partner John O'Farrell. "This is not Fund III. This is a completely discretionary fund that gives us more firepower to invest in great high-quality, high-growth companies along with Fund II, but there is no obligation to do so," he says. In other words, the firm may invest all of the $200 million, none of it or somewhere in between. At the end of Fund II, it goes away no matter how much is left.

And this may be the biggest distinction from other growth funds: Andressen Horowitz is not charging investors any management fees associated with this fund.]]></description>

Andreessen Horowitz has just announced a new growth fund of $200 million. The fund with co-invest alongside the firm&#8217;s most recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/andreessen-horowitz-650m-fund/">$650 million fund</a>, providing more capital for the kinds of late stage deals that have been raging in the Valley of late.

<p>That &#8220;co-invest&#8221; part is makes this announcement very different from other firms&#8217; late stage funds, says general partner John O&#8217;Farrell. &#8220;This is not Fund III. This is a completely discretionary fund that gives us more firepower to invest in great high-quality, high-growth companies along with Fund II, but there is no obligation to do so,&#8221; he says. In other words, the firm may invest all of the $200 million, none of it or somewhere in between. At the end of Fund II, it goes away no matter how much is left.</p>
<p>And this may be the biggest distinction from other growth funds: Andressen Horowitz is not charging investors any management fees associated with this fund. &#8220;We wanted to be completely aligned with investors,&#8221; O&#8217;Farrell says. &#8220;If it&#8217;s truly a discretionary fund, we should not be charging management fees on it. We would be doing that due diligence work anyway since this co-invests with Fund II. Why double up on the fees?&#8221; (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/29/benchmark-capitals-stand-we-will-never-do-a-seed-or-late-stage-fund/">Big points scored</a> with the firm&#8217;s limited partners there, and a big message sent to other firms. Fees on growth funds are one of the most contentious issues in the industry today.)</p>
<p>Notable late stage investments made so far by Andreessen Horowitz include Skype, Zynga, Facebook, Twitter and most-recently Jawbone. There are more details in a <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/06/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-200mm-co-investment-fund/">guest post</a> by O&#8217;Farrell on Ben Horowitz&#8217;s blog. (Come on, guys! Can&#8217;t O&#8217;Farrell get his own blog?)</p>
<p>We spoke with O&#8217;Farrell about what opportunities are still out there now that the big social media plays like Facebook, Twitter, Zynga and Groupon are plied full of late-stage cash. O&#8217;Farrell obviously didn&#8217;t want to name names of deals that aren&#8217;t yet done, but he pointed to two existing portfolio companies as examples: Jawbone and Box.Net. One is a consumer products company and one is an enterprise company; two industries that can require large amounts of growth capital to go truly mainstream. &#8220;They aren&#8217;t household names yet, but we believe they will be,&#8221; O&#8217;Farrell says. Another promising vertical is e-commerce, he said.</p>
<p>He drew a distinction between &#8220;high-growth&#8221; and &#8220;high-quality,&#8221; saying the firm turns down companies that are merely growing quickly all the time if they don&#8217;t have a stellar management team and a truly global market opportunity. He also noted that profitability wasn&#8217;t necessarily a requirement. &#8221;A company may well still be losing money if they are investing very heavily in marketing, but as long as we can see the lifetime value of a customer is greater than the cost of acquiring them, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he says.<br />

<p>By far the most difficult skill for me to learn as CEO was the ability to manage my own psychology. Organizational design, process design, metrics, hiring and firing were all relatively straightforward skills to master compared to keeping my mind in check. Over the years, I’ve spoken to hundreds of CEOs all with the same experience. Nonetheless, very few people talk about it, and I have never read anything on the topic. It’s like the fight club of management: The first rule of the CEO psychological meltdown is don’t talk about the psychological meltdown.</p>
<p>At risk of violating the sacred rule, I will attempt to describe the condition and prescribe some techniques that helped me. In the end, this is the most personal and important battle that any CEO will face.</p>
<h2>If I’m Doing a Good Job, Why Do I Feel So Bad?</h2>
<p>Generally, someone doesn’t become CEOs unless she has a high sense of purpose and cares deeply about the work she does. In addition, a CEO must be accomplished enough or smart enough that people will want to work for her. Nobody sets out to be a bad CEO, run a dysfunctional organization, or create a massive bureaucracy that grinds her company to a screeching halt. Yet no CEO ever has a smooth path to a great company. Along the way, many things go wrong and all of them could have and should have been avoided.</p>
<p>Things go wrong, because building a multi-faceted human organization to compete and win in a dynamic, highly competitive market turns out to be really hard. If CEOs were graded on a curve, the mean on the test would be 22 out of a 100. This kind of mean can be psychologically challenging for a straight A student. It is particularly challenging, because nobody tells you that the mean is 22.</p>
<p>If you manage a team of 10 people, it’s quite possible to do so with very few mistakes or bad behaviors. If you manage an organization of 1,000 people it is quite impossible. At a certain size, your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that you’d be associated with that kind of incompetence. Seeing people fritter away money, waste each other’s time, and do sloppy work can make you feel bad. If you are the CEO, it may well make you sick.</p>
<p>And to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse, it’s your fault.</p>
<h2>Nobody to Blame</h2>
<p><em>“You can’t blame Jazz Musicians or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues”</em> —Nas</p>
<p>When people in my company would complain about something or other being broken such as the expense reporting process, I would joke that it was all my fault. The joke was funny, because it wasn’t really a joke. Every problem in the company was indeed my fault. As the founding CEO, every hire and every decision that the company ever made happened under my direction. Unlike a hired gun that comes in and blames all of the problems on the prior regime, there was literally nobody for me to blame.</p>
<p>If someone was promoted for all the wrong reasons, that was my fault. If we missed the quarterly earnings target, that was my fault. If a great engineer quit, that was my fault. If the sales team made unreasonable demands on the product organization, then that was my fault. If the product had too many bugs, that was my fault. It kind of sucked to be me.</p>
<p>Being responsible for everything and getting a 22 on the test starts to weigh on your consciousness.</p>
<h2>Too Much Broken Stuff</h2>
<p>Given this stress, CEOs often make the one of the following two mistakes:</p>
<p>1. They take things too personally</p>
<p>2. They do not take things personally enough</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the CEO takes every issue incredibly seriously and personally and urgently moves to fix it. Given the volume of the issues, this motion usually results in one of two scenarios. If the CEO is outwardly focused, she ends up terrorizing the team to the point where nobody wants to work at the company any more. If the CEO is inwardly focused, she ends up feeling so sick from all of the problems that she can barely make it to work in the morning.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, in order to dampen the pain of the rolling disaster that is the company, the CEO takes a Pollyannaish attitude: it’s not so bad. In this view, none of the problems are actually that bad and they needn’t be dealt with urgently. By rationalizing away the issues, the CEO feels better about herself. The problem is that she doesn’t actually fix any of the problems and the employees eventually become quite frustrated that the Chief Executive keeps ignoring the most basic problems and conflicts. Ultimately, the company turns to crap.</p>
<p>Ideally, the CEO will be urgent yet not insane. She will move aggressively and decisively without feeling emotionally culpable. If she can separate the importance of the issues from how she feels about them, she will avoid demonizing her employees or herself.</p>
<h2>It’s a Lonely Job</h2>
<p><em>“And this loneliness won’t leave me alone”</em> —Otis Redding</p>
<p>In your darkest moments as CEO, discussing fundamental questions about the viability of your company with your employees can have obvious negative consequences. On the other hand, talking to your board and outside advisors can be fruitless. The knowledge gap between you and them is so vast that you cannot actually bring them fully up to speed in a manner that’s useful in making the decision. You are all alone.</p>
<p>At Loudcloud, when the dot com bubble burst and subsequently sent most of our customers into bankruptcy, it crippled our business and devastated our balance sheet. Or rather, that was one interpretation. Another interpretation, and necessarily the official story for the company, was that we still had plenty of money in the bank and were signing up traditional enterprise customers at an impressive rate. Which interpretation was closer to the truth? In the absence of someone to talk to, that’s a question that I asked myself about 3,000 times. As an aside, asking oneself anything 3,000 times turns out to be a bad idea. In this case, I had two specific difficult questions:</p>
<p>1. What if the official interpretation was wrong?  What if I was misleading everyone from investors to employees? In that case, I should be removed from my position immediately.</p>
<p>2. What if the official interpretation was right? What if I was grinding my brain into sawdust for no reason at all? What if I was taking the company off track by questioning my own direction? In that case, I should be removed from my position immediately.</p>
<p>As is usually the case, there was no way to know which interpretation was right until much later. It turned out that neither was actually right. The new customers didn’t save us, but we figured out another way to survive and ultimately succeed. The key to getting to the right outcome was to keep from getting married to either the positive or the dark narrative.</p>
<p>My friend Jason Rosenthal took over as CEO of Ning about a year ago. As soon as he became CEO, he faced a cash crisis and had to choose amongst three difficult choices: 1. Radically reduce the size of the company or 2. Sell the company or 3. Raise money in a highly dilutive way.</p>
<p>Think about those choices:</p>
<p>1. Lay off a large set of talented employees whom he worked very hard to recruit and, as a result, likely severely damage the morale of the remaining people.</p>
<p>2. Sell out all of the employees who he had been working side-by-side with for the past several years (Jason was promoted into the position), by selling the company without giving them a chance to perform or fulfill their mission.</p>
<p>3. Drastically reduce the ownership position of the employees and make their hard work economically meaningless.</p>
<p>Choices like these separate the women from the girls. Tip to aspiring entrepreneurs: if you don’t like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don’t become CEO. Jason sought advice from some of the best minds in the industry, but ultimately he was completely alone in the final decision. Nobody had the answer and whatever the answer, Jason was the one who had to live with the consequences. So far his decision to reduce staff by letting go of primarily the most recent hires has paid off. Revenue at Ning is soaring and team morale is high. If it had gone worse (or ultimately goes bad), it will be all Jason’s fault and it will be up to Jason to find a new answer. Whenever I see Jason, I like to say: “Welcome to the show.”</p>
<h2>Techniques to Calm Your Nerves</h2>
<p>The problem with psychology is that everybody’s is slightly different. With that as a caveat, over the years I developed a few techniques for dealing with myself. Hopefully, you find them useful too.</p>
<p><em>Make some friends</em>—Although it’s nearly impossible to get high quality advice on the tough decisions that you make, it is extremely useful from a psychological perspective to talk to people who have been through similarly challenging decisions. My friend Bill Campbell was a huge help to me as CEO, but interestingly it wasn’t his great success running Intuit that I found most useful; it was his disastrous experience running Go. Through that experience and his most traumatic days at Intuit (like laying off 1/3 of the company), Bill learned a tremendous amount about how to think about excruciatingly difficult decisions from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p><em>Get it out of your head and onto paper</em>—When I had to explain to Bill and the rest of my board that, as a public company, I thought that it would be best if we sold all of our customers and all of our revenue and changed business, it was messing with my mind. In order to finalize that decision, I wrote down a detailed explanation of my logic. The process of writing that document separated me from my own psychology and enabled me to make the decision swiftly.</p>
<p><em>Focus on the road not the wall—</em>When they train racecar drivers, one of the first lessons is when you are going around a curve at 200 MPH, do not focus on the wall; focus on the road. If you focus on the wall, you will drive right into it. If you focus on the road, you will follow the road. Running a company is like that. There are always a thousand things that can go wrong and sink the ship. If you focus too much on them, you will drive yourself nuts and likely capsize your company. Focus on where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Be a Punk.</h2>
<p>A Final Word of Advice – Don’t Punk Out and Don’t Quit As CEO, there will be many times when you feel like quitting. I have seen CEOs try to cope with the stress by drinking heavily, checking out, and even quitting. In each case, the CEO has a marvelous rationalization why it was OK for him to punk out or quit, but none them will every be great CEOs. Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweat, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary founder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls “the torture.” Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say: “I didn’t quit.”</p>

<p>In the mid-2000s when nearly every top venture capital firm was expanding to India and China, Benchmark Capital did not share its peers&#8217; worldly ambitions. In fact, while the firm retained its Israel fund (for now?), it spun off the top performing UK fund <a href="http://www.balderton.com/">Balderton Capital</a> and retrained its focus firmly on the US.</p>

It refused to compete with the Ron Conways and Mike Maples of the world; it would wait its turn and invest later.</p>
<p>And now &#8211; as Benchmark&#8217;s early stage peers are raising $1 billion growth funds and throwing huge sums of money at established companies like Facebook, Zynga and Groupon &#8211; once again, Benchmark Capital is refusing to follow suit. It quietly closed its new fund in January. There was no press release, and it was for the exact same amount of money as the last: $425 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making a very conscious bet here,&#8221; said general partner Bill Gurley in an exclusive sit-down interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;Where we&#8217;ve been has played a big role in who we are today. What we took away from the past is what it is we do well, and that&#8217;s classic early stage investing, taking board seats and adding value to each company on a high-service level. Those other things&#8211; late stage, seed stage, cleantech, international&#8211; all distract from that.&#8221; The kind of masters-of-the-universe swagger documented by Randall Stross in his <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324735.eBoys">bubble era book about Benchmark</a>? Never again, says Gurley. Adds general partner Matt Cohler, &#8220;Our aim is to be the entrepreneur&#8217;s first phone call. That doesn&#8217;t scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is hardly the first time a top Sand Hill Road firm has uttered these sentiments. Everyone said them back in 2002 or so, when nearly every $1 billion fund was &#8220;right-sized,&#8221; management fees were returned to investors and general partners sheepishly admitted that the venture business was a boutique industry that just doesn&#8217;t scale. The difference is that Gurley and Cohler are still saying it at a time when many of their peers seem to have swung back to we-can-do-it-all extremes.</p>
<p>Sure, plenty of venture funds haven&#8217;t raised a mega-late stage fund. But that&#8217;s because most of them can&#8217;t. Benchmark is one of the handful of firms that could raise as much cash as it wants, but it is stubbornly refusing to deviate from classic, board-seat-taking, apprentice-style, we-don&#8217;t-have-a-million-associates-we-just-have-general-partners style of venture capital. Did Benchmark invest in Facebook? Nope. And unlike competitors, they&#8217;ve moved on. Sure, some argue they pay up on sky-high valuations like the rest of the Valley, particularly for companies like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/13/twitter-raises-third-round-of-funding-from-benchmark-and-ivp/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/28/quora-has-the-magic-benchmark-invests-at-86-million-valuation/">Quora</a>. But for Benchmark, &#8220;paying up&#8221; is more like paying a valuation in the hundreds of millions, not tens of billions.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the real value of investing in Facebook at a heady $30 billion valuation? It probably won&#8217;t lose money, but it&#8217;s hard to argue it&#8217;ll yield a venture-style return. (That term is thrown around a lot these days. For the record, Benchmark considers a venture-style return to be ten times invested capital.) That means there are two benefits: Marketing and access to the greater Facebook network. When Benchmark missed the early rounds of Facebook, the firm went another route to getting Facebook cred and connections: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/06/19/the-matt-cohler-exit-interview/">Hiring Cohler</a>, an early Facebook executive, as a general partner. While other firms have chased later and later Facebook secondary deals, Cohler has been gobbling up some of the better investments from the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-dna-of-the-facebook-mafia/">Facebook diaspora</a> like Quora and Asana.</p>
<p>The difference in approach delights some major limited partners who I spoke with over the last few weeks. Each requested anonymity for obvious reasons: Getting in the top firms isn&#8217;t easy, and no LP wants to be on the record criticizing one over the other. But this comment was echoed by several pension funds and endowments: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been a little frustrated at this next level of product extension. We have seen that early stage doesn&#8217;t scale. With very few exceptions, the jury is pretty clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides, many of the top LPs that may be in Benchmark are also in Accel or Greylock&#8211; firms that got into Facebook already at a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/is-late-stage-the-new-early/">much nicer price</a>. For them, shares at $30 billion don&#8217;t have much of an upside. &#8220;We like our cost basis in Facebook,&#8221; one LP said. &#8220;We were fortunate to be in this company early. We don&#8217;t need to double and triple down at these levels.&#8221; In other words: Let the LPs control their own allocation, don&#8217;t try to control it for them. Of Benchmark this LP said, &#8220;I am looking for category killers, and that is what they are looking to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, several funds getting into the late stage business have noted that no one is holding a gun to these LPs&#8217; heads. They&#8217;re choosing to back these mega-funds, and if they don&#8217;t want to, plenty of others will. That&#8217;s true, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they love the strategy. Frequently, top firms raise expansion funds at the same time they raise early stage funds and the implication is clear: If you want to keep your place in one, you better pay up for the new vehicle too. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tough conversation, because capital calls have been running at a pretty fast clip, but the liquidity isn&#8217;t covering those capital calls,&#8221; one LP said.</p>
<p>In other words, LPs have been generous with venture capital allocations and those firms are investing in more and more companies. But for the last decade, returns have been abysmal. LPs get that returns take time in the venture business, but there&#8217;s a limit to how long they can wait. As a result, it&#8217;s one of the first sustained periods in more than a decade where there is not a flood of capital trying to wedge itself into the venture business. Quite the opposite: Most LPs are uncomfortably over-exposed to the asset class.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the biggest complaint roiling LPs: The fees. &#8220;The ugliest part of this is the same fee streams are attached to these funds, a 2-2.5% management fee and a 30% carry,&#8221; said one LP. &#8220;Even though some firms say the justification for keeping the growth funds separate is they don&#8217;t want lower returns to drag down the early stage fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most LPs I talked to granted many of these late stage deals&#8211; like the ones detailed in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/is-late-stage-the-new-early/">part one</a> of this series on the new late stage frenzy&#8211; were unique opportunities, filling a void in the market for great companies that already have sizable revenues and didn&#8217;t want to go public but needed capital. But as we wrote last week, the fear is there are only so many of those companies out there. &#8220;We like firms that give us the option, but not the obligation,&#8221; said one LP, with several others echoing the sentiment. That&#8217;s precisely the reason some firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Greylock do mega-deals out of the same fund&#8211; if they never find another good one, they can shift their focus back to early stage.</p>
<p>For the broader startup ecosystem, the question isn&#8217;t whether Benchmark can ignore late stage deals and still make money. The firm is in solid shape with investments in Yelp and Twitter and up-and-comers like Quora, Asana and Uber, not to mention decent exits in Mint, Riot Games and <a href="http://www.servicesource.com/">ServiceSource</a>, which went public just last week. Nor is the question really whether other VCs will lose money on these heady deals. That&#8217;s the core distinction between what some in the media are calling a bubble now, and <em>an actual bubble</em> like the one in the late 1990s where the public participated in wild speculation. Top venture firms can lose some money or break even on a few deals, and the economic fall-out will be pretty minimal.</p>
<p>The real question for the industry is about the opportunity cost of distraction should the later stage opportunity prove, once again, to look better on paper than in the actual returns paid to investors. Benchmark believes its stance will give the firm an advantage over its peers when it comes to investing in the next generation of winners. The social media giants have been pretty well sorted out, now it&#8217;s just a question of who can grab remaining stakes and at what price.</p>
<p>But what about the next generation? Conflicts are just now starting to surface, as many entrepreneurs trying to disrupt giants like Zynga, Groupon or Facebook quietly express reservations about taking money from a firm that has more money in those companies than it will ever put in any early stage deal, no matter how good. It&#8217;s hard to know where loyalties lie in these situations and the question of conflicts within venture portfolios is coming up again and again on entrepreneur and <a href="http://bijansabet.com/page/2">VC blogs</a> and in our own episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/18/ask-a-vc-peter-barris-on-scaling-the-vc-business-and-snagging-the-first-stake-in-groupon-tctv/">Ask a VC</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, some other firms have noted in private conversations that late stage investments not only raised competitive issues with early stage hopeful-competitors, but with international companies competing with Zynga and Groupon in their home markets. The surface of these competitive ramifications hasn&#8217;t even been scratched yet. &#8221;It creates weird situations where bigger chunks of money tend to steal the attention,&#8221; Gurley says. &#8220;At that level, fees can be distracting.&#8221;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venture firm <a href="http://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a> continues its expansion today, bringing on former Veritas and Citrix Exec Peter Levine as a venture partner. Most recently, the firm added <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/andreessen-horowitz-finally-adds-a-third-general-partner-scott-weiss/">entrepreneur Scott Weiss</a> as general partner. With Levine, Andreessen Horowitz, which is just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/andreessen-horowitz-650m-fund/">shy of $1 billion</a> under management, gets a seasoned executive in the areas of virtualization and data storage.</p>
<p>As a venture partner, Levine&#8217;s role will include most of a the activities of a general partner (i.e., joining boards, working with entrepreneurs, driving deal flow, full access to the Andreessen Horowitz network) but not necessarily with a full-time commitment. Levine also lectures at MIT&#8217;s Sloan School of Management and will continue to serve as senior vice president of Strategic Development at Citrix.</p>
<p>At the firm, Levine will focus on investments in the &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; area, which broadly includes cloud computing, networking, virtualization, and storage software companies. In conjunction with the announcement, Andreessen Horowitz has announced Levine&#8217;s first investment as a partner—<a href="http://www.bromium.com/">Bromium</a>. The company is still in stealth, but Horowitz tells us that the startup is at the intersection of &#8220;security and virtualization.&#8221; As part of the undisclosed round of funding, Levine will be joining Bromium&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>While the virtualization and storage industries aren&#8217;t as sexy as group buying or social gaming, they are capable of bringing in massive exits. HP <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2010/09/02/dell-withdraws-from-3par-bidding-war/">acquired 3Par </a>for a whopping $2.4 billion and EMC just <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2010/11/15/emc-buys-enterprise-data-storage-company-isilon-for-2-25-billion-in-cash/">acquired Ipsilon</a> for a cool $2.25 billion. And Goldman Sachs just put $70 million in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/22/goldman-sachs-pumps-a-whopping-70m-into-virtualization-company-appsense/">virtualization company AppSense.</a> The list goes on.</p>
<p>To say that Levine&#8217;s expertise in these areas of enterprise software is extensive is probably an understatement.</p>
<p>Levine was an early employee of Veritas Software and during his 11-year tenure with the company, helped to grow the organization from no revenue to more than $1.5B, and from 20 employees to more than 6,000. By the time he left Veritas in 2001, Levine was executive vice president for Strategic and Platform Operations.  Prior to Veritas, he was a software engineer at MIT’s Project Athena and began his career as a software engineer at Spectrum Software.</p>
<p>After his time at Veritas, Levine was a general partner at the Mayfield Fund, where he focused on investing in enterprise software companies including Mendocino Software, Centrify, Zenprise, TrueDemand, OuterBay (acquired by HP), and Actona, (acquired by Cisco). Levine left Mayfield to become CEO of enterprise virtualization software company XenSource, which was subsequently acquired by Citrix for $500 million. At Citrix, Levine was the senior vice president and general manager of the Data Center and Cloud Division.</p>
<p>Ben Horowitz, who spent six months trying to recruit Levine, tells us that there were three main drivers in wanting to bring on Levine as a venture partner. First, both he and Marc Andreessen have always wanted to work with Levine, based on his reputation alone. Second, he says that Levine makes the firm much smarter in two main areas: 1. enterprise infrastructure (particularly with relation to virtualization and storage) and 2. sales channel models for enterprise products, which Levine was able to accomplish at Veritas. And lastly, Horowitz says that Levine&#8217;s extensive network at a variety of organizations and companies, including MIT, Veritas, and Citrix, make him an ideal addition.  He says of Levine, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to find a beter expert or networked person in this domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why Levine, who always wanted to rejoin the venture industry, chose to join Andreessen Horowitz in particular, his decision came down two a few factors. First, the firm&#8217;s software focus was appealing. Horowitz, Andreessen and a number of the firm&#8217;s other employees worked at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/14/andreessen-horowitz-hires-a-new-partner-from-sales/">Opsware previously.</a> &#8220;I like that the firm&#8217;s investment strategy focuses on investing around companies that try to solve hard problems through software.&#8221; And second, Levine says that the firm&#8217;s priority of the entrepreneur as a customer was important to him.</p>
<p>So will we continue to see Andreessen Horowitz beef up its venture team? Horowitz says yes, and that the firm will continue to add other types of partners (i.e. general) at a faster pace that venture partners. One thing is for sure—the firm is setting itself up to be a giant in the enterprise software investing space.</p>
